# Array-Minesweeper

A sfml-based game with the implementation of the classic **Minesweeper** game using C++ and arrays. The game allows players to uncover cells and avoid hidden mines in a grid-based environment. This project showcases foundational knowledge of arrays, game logic, and basic C++ programming.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

  - Grid-based Minesweeper board
  - Randomized mine placement
  - Win by revealing all safe cells
  - Lose if you uncover a mine

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

  - C++
  - SFML

## 🚀 How to Run

  ### Prerequisites

  - A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
  - SFML

  ### Steps

  1. Clone the repository:

       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/Chintan-Patel-Games/Arrays-Minesweeper.git
       cd Arrays-Minesweeper
       ```
     
  2. Compile the code:

      ```bash
      g++ main.cpp Board.cpp Game.cpp -o Minesweeper
      ```

  3. Run the executable:

      ```bash
      ./Minesweeper
      ```

## 📚 Concepts Demonstrated

  - 2D Arrays and memory handling
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Procedural game loop
  - Input handling and validation
  - Random number generation for mine placement

## 🧠 Future Improvements

  - Add difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
  - Timer and score tracking
  - Enhanced UI with colorized output
  - Save/load game states
